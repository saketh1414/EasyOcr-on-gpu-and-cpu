# Easyocr-on-gpu-and-cpu

This project is all about using GPU based OCR model and converting the model in such a way it runs efficiently and accurately on cpu.
techniques like Quantization and stepping of frames are used. this will imporve the over all time taken by the model and ensures accuracy and efficiency.
